<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I once knew quite a bit of HTML; I even got pretty ok at amature-level CSS. Now that I'm in a position where I have to use it–it is pretty clear that I am out of practice. My previous learing and experience was merely a matter of leasure. I'm looking forward to having some consequence applied. </p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>As you can see, I have used the template HTML for the structure. I have next–to–no experience with Github, so navigating this assignemnt has been a bit of a challenge. <br> More than I thought it would be. </br> So far, after doing the obvious (e.g. creating a Github account) I have created an HTML file directly in the online repository. I didnt see anything in the rubric that suggested I must link the repository to a directory on my computer, but I will certainly want to do that. I have created this for the purpose of completion. This weekend, I will be figuring out how to integrate the desktop Github application and a local repository. </p>

Nam augue nisi, varius ac velit eu, suscipit lacinia diam. </p>
